QUESTION:- Create a query to find out how many times each room has been booked and calculate the total revenue generated from those reservations, 
considering the number of nights booked. Display the results with the room having the highest bookings at the top, followed by descending order based on the booking frequency.

Tables are:- rooms , rentalHistory 

Solution 1:- In PostgreSQL
With details AS (
SELECT rooms.room_id, rooms.name, rooms.description,
(price * rentalHistory.number_nights) AS totalSpent
FROM rooms INNER JOIN rentalHistory
ON rooms.room_id=rentalHistory.room_id
)
SELECT name, description, COUNT(*) AS totalBooking,
SUM(totalSpent) AS totalEarning
FROM details
GROUP BY name, description
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC

Solution 2:- In PostgreSQL
SELECT 
    r.name, 
    r.description, 
    COUNT(rh.rental_id) AS number_of_bookings,
    SUM(rh.number_nights*r.price) AS total_earnings 
FROM rooms r 
INNER JOIN rentalHistory rh ON r.room_id = rh.room_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
