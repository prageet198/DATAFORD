QUESTION:-A company is planning to hire candidates for both junior and senior roles with a budget cap of $50,000. The hiring process prioritizes 
filling senior positions first, followed by junior positions.

For instance, suppose the budget is $55,000, with each senior role offering $20,000 and junior roles $10,000. 
In this scenario, the company can hire 2 senior candidates (as hiring 3 would exceed the budget) and 1 junior candidate to use 
the remaining budget after allocating funds for senior roles.

Write a SQL query to calculate how many senior and junior positions the company can fill within the given budget using the candidates table.

Table is:- candidates 

Solution:- In Postgre
--GET RUNNING SALARIES BASED ON POSTIONS
WITH salaries AS (
SELECT * ,
SUM(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY positions ORDER BY salary) AS runningSalries
FROM candidates
),
seniorCounts AS (
SELECT COUNT(*) AS noOfSeniors,
COALESCE(SUM(salary), 0) AS total_salary
FROM salaries
WHERE positions='senior' AND runningSalries<=50000
),
juniorCounts AS (
SELECT COUNT(*) AS noOfJuniors,
COALESCE(SUM(salary), 0) AS total_salary
FROM salaries
WHERE positions='junior' AND runningSalries<=50000 - (SELECT total_salary FROM seniorCounts)
)
SELECT noOfSeniors, noOfJuniors
FROM seniorCounts,juniorCounts
