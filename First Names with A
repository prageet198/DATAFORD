QUESTION:- Your goal is to return the names of the student that starts with the letter 'A' (it can also start with lower caps) along with their count. 
Letâ€™s say table has "Alan" and "adam" as entry. The output should be 2, Alan, adam (delimited by a comma and a space).

Table is:- students 

Solution 1:- In Postgre
SELECT CONCAT(cnt,', ',ff) AS output FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, STRING_AGG(first_name, ', ') AS ff FROM (SELECT first_name FROM students WHERE first_name like 'A%'
UNION ALL
SELECT first_name FROM students WHERE first_name like 'a%') AS A) AS B

Solution 2:- In Postgre
WITH my_first_names AS (
    SELECT
        COUNT(*) AS total_count,
        STRING_AGG(first_name, ', ') AS first_names
    FROM students
    WHERE LEFT(LOWER(first_name), 1) = 'a'
)
SELECT CONCAT(total_count, ', ', first_names) AS output
FROM my_first_names;
