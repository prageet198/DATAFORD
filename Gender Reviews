QUESTION:- Imagine you're a Data Analyst at Airbnb. The product manager wants you to figure out if a guest's gender affects the average review score they give. 
You'll use the "from_type" column to identify guest reviews. "from_user" is the user_id that made the review and "to_user" is the user_id that received the review.

Your job is to show which gender tends to give higher review scores. The end result will be a clear list of genders and their average review scores. 
Round your results to 3 decimal points.

Tables are:- reviews , guests 

Solution:- In PostgreSQL
SELECT guests.gender, ROUND(AVG(review_score),3) AS abgScores
FROM reviews INNER JOIN guests ON reviews.from_user=guests.guest_id AND reviews.from_type='guest'
GROUP BY guests.gender
ORDER BY ROUND(AVG(review_score),3) DESC
LIMIT 1
