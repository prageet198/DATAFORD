QUESTION:-Write a query to identify the top 2 busiest times of the week for the company based on the criteria provided:

    Morning: Before 12 a.m. (not inclusive)
    Early afternoon: 12 p.m. - 3 p.m. (inclusive)
    Late afternoon: after 3 p.m.

Your output should include the day and time of day combination for the 2 busiest times, along with the number of orders. 
The day should be displayed in text format (e.g. Monday instead of 1). In the event of a tie in ranking, all results should be displayed.

Table is:- sales_log 

To convert any date to a Day format use: TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp), 'Day') AS day
WITH combineData AS(
SELECT order_id,
TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp), 'Day') AS orderdDay,
EXTRACT(HOUR FROM timestamp) AS orderdTime,
timestamp
FROM sales_log 
),
calculation AS(
SELECT order_id,
orderdDay,
orderdTime,
CASE WHEN orderdTime<'12' THEN 'Morning'
     WHEN orderdTime<'15' THEN 'Early afternoon' 
     ELSE 'Late afternoon' END  AS timeOfDay
FROM combineData
),
totalOrder AS (
SELECT orderdday, timeofday, COUNT(*) AS totalOrders
FROM calculation
GROUP BY  orderdday, timeofday
),
ranking AS(
SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY totalOrders DESC) AS ranked FROM totalOrder
)
SELECT orderdday, timeofday, totalOrders FROM ranking WHERE ranked IN (1,2)
