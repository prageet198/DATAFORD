QUESTION:- Your team at JPMorgan Chase is preparing to launch a new credit card and needs to estimate how many cards will be issued in its first month.

Your task is to write a SQL query to find out how many cards were issued in the first month of previous card launches. 
The query should display each credit card's name alongside the quantity issued in its launch month.

Hint: To identify the launch month, refer to the earliest record for each card

Table is:- monthly_cards_issued 

Solution-1:- In Postgre
WITH allData AS (
SELECT card_name, issued_amount,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY card_name ORDER BY issue_year, issue_month) AS rmm
FROM monthly_cards_issued
)
SELECT card_name, issued_amount FROM allData WHERE rmm='1'

Solution-2:- In Postgre
WITH card_launch AS (
    SELECT
        card_name,
        issued_amount,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY card_name ORDER BY issue_year) AS rnk_year,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY card_name, issue_year ORDER BY issue_month) AS rnk_month
    FROM
        monthly_cards_issued)

SELECT
    card_name,
    issued_amount
FROM card_launch
WHERE rnk_year = 1 AND rnk_month = 1
