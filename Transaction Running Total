QUESTION:-Given a table of transactions with transaction dates and amounts, write a SQL query to calculate the running total for each day.

For instance, if transactions on the first day total $20 and on the second day total $30, the output for the first day should be $20 
and for the second day $50 (which is $20 from the first day plus $30 from the second).

Table is:- transactions 

Solution:-
WITH overallTotal AS (
SELECT transaction_date,
SUM(amount) AS totalAmt
FROM transactions
GROUP BY transaction_date
)
SELECT transaction_date ,
SUM(totalAmt) OVER (ORDER BY transaction_date) AS running_total
FROM overallTotal
