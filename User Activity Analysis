QUESTION:-Write a SQL query to obtain a breakdown by age group of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a % of total time spent. 
The total time spent should only include these 2 activities (sending and opening).

For instance, If a user group spends 5 minutes opening snaps and 10 minutes sending snaps, the query should calculate the % of time 
opening snaps as 5 divided by 15 (10+5) and the % of time sending snaps as 10 divided by 15.

Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

Tables are:- activities, age_breakdown 

Solution:- In Postgre
WITH combineData AS(
SELECT
age_breakdown.age_bucket,
SUM (CASE WHEN activity_type='open' THEN time_spent END) AS totalOpenTime,
SUM (CASE WHEN activity_type='send' THEN time_spent END) AS totalSendTime
FROM activities INNER JOIN age_breakdown 
ON activities.user_id=age_breakdown.user_id
GROUP BY age_bucket
)
SELECT age_bucket ,
ROUND((totalOpenTime/(totalOpenTime+totalSendTime)),2) AS openPerc,
ROUND((totalSendTime/(totalOpenTime+totalSendTime)),2) AS sendPerc
FROM combineData ORDER BY age_bucket
