QUESTION:- As the holiday season nears, your team is gearing up for heightened sales during Christmas. To effectively prepare, you've been assigned the 
task of identifying the 2 top-performing restaurants based on sales by their IDs.

Make sure to exclude any orders with blank values in the actual_delivery_time field, as they mean that they were not received and 
for this reason should not be considered as part of the monthly sales calculation.

Tables are:- order_value , delivery_orders 

Solution:- In Postgre
WITH totalSales AS(
SELECT delivery_orders.restaurant_name, SUM(order_value .sales_amount) AS totalSales
FROM delivery_orders 
INNER JOIN order_value 
ON delivery_orders.delivery_id=order_value .delivery_id
WHERE actual_delivery_time IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY delivery_orders.restaurant_name
),
ranking AS (
SELECT restaurant_name, totalSales, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY totalSales DESC) AS ranked
FROM totalSales
)
SELECT restaurant_name, totalSales FROM ranking WHERE ranked IN (1,2)
