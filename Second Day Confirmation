QUESTION:-Assuming that the emails table contains information about the email addresses of new TikTok users and the texts table contains information about the text 
confirmation received by each user, write a SQL query that retrieves the IDs of the users who did not confirm on the first day of sign-up, but confirmed on the second day.

Tables are:- emails , texts 

Solution 1:- In PostgreSQL
SELECT user_id
FROM emails INNER JOIN texts ON emails.email_id=texts.email_id
WHERE signup_action='Confirmed' AND (texts.action_date - signup_date)='1'
ORDER BY texts.email_id

Solution 2:- In PostgreSQL
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM emails e
INNER JOIN texts t ON e.email_id = t.email_id
WHERE  t.signup_action = 'Confirmed' AND t.action_date = e.signup_date + INTERVAL '1 day'
