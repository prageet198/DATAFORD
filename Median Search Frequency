QUESTION:-Google's marketing team is making a Superbowl commercial and needs a simple statistic to put on their TV ad: the median number of 
searches a person made last year.

However, at Google's scale, querying the 2 trillion searches is too costly. Luckily, you have access to the summary table 
which tells you the number of searches made last year and how many Google users fall into that bucket.

Write a query to report the median of searches made by a user. Round the median to 1 decimal point.

HINT: Think about expanding the search_frequency table to have something like [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]

Table is :-search_frequency 

Solution:- In Postgre
WITH searches_expanded AS (
  SELECT searches
  FROM search_frequency
  CROSS JOIN GENERATE_SERIES(1,num_users)
)
SELECT 
  ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY searches)::DECIMAL, 1) AS  median
FROM searches_expanded;
