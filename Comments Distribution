Solution:- In Postgre
WITH userComments AS (

FROM users LEFT JOIN comments 
ON users.id=user_id
GROUP BY users.id
),
commentBucket AS (
SELECT DISTINCT(totalComments) AS r1 FROM userComments
),
commentsCount AS(
SELECT totalComments AS r2, COUNT(*) AS cumTotal
FROM userComments
GROUP BY totalComments
),
overAllCalculation AS (
SELECT r1, cumTotal
FROM commentBucket INNER JOIN commentsCount
ON r1=r2
ORDER BY r1
)
SELECT r1,
SUM(cumTotal) OVER(ORDER BY r1) AS cumulativeTotal
FROM overAllCalculation
