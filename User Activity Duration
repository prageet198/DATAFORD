QUESTION:- Your goal is to calculate the total active hours for each user. You should use the start and end times of user sessions, defined by the session state: '1' 
for session start and '0' for session end.

Table is user_sessions 

Solution-1:- In Postgre
With allData AS(
SELECT *,
LAG (timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS previousStartTime
FROM user_sessions 
ORDER BY customer_id
),
timeDifference AS(
SELECT customer_id, ROUND(ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp::time - previousstarttime::time)) / 60)) AS time_difference_minutes
FROM allData 
WHERE state='0'
)
SELECT customer_id, ROUND(SUM(time_difference_minutes)/60,16) AS totalTime
FROM timeDifference
GROUP BY customer_id

Solution-2:- In Postgre
WITH my_sessions AS (
SELECT
    *,
    timestamp AS start_session,
    LEAD(timestamp) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id
    ORDER BY timestamp) AS end_session

FROM user_sessions),

my_duration AS (
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    start_session,
    end_session,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM end_session-start_session)/3600 AS nb_hours
FROM my_sessions
WHERE state = 1)

SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(nb_hours) AS total_hours
FROM my_duration
GROUP BY 1;
