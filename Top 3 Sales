QUESTION:- The sales team is keen on identifying the months with the highest sales. Using the provided sales data, your task is to determine the top three year-month combinations for sales.

Your output should feature the top three monthly sales in the format YYYY-MM, along with the corresponding cumulative sales.

Table is:- fct_customer_sales 

Solution 1:- In Postgresql
WITH yearMonth AS (
SELECT EXTRACT(Year FROM order_date) AS salesYear, LPAD(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)::TEXT, 2, '0') AS salesMonth, order_value
FROM fct_customer_sales
),
totalSales AS (
SELECT salesYear, salesMonth, SUM (order_value) AS totalYearMonthSales
FROM yearMonth
GROUP BY salesYear, salesMonth
),
ranking AS (
SELECT * , RANK () OVER (ORDER BY totalYearMonthSales DESC) AS ranked
FROM totalSales
)
SELECT CONCAT (salesYear, '-',salesMonth) AS salesMonth, totalYearMonthSales FROM ranking
WHERE ranked <=3
ORDER BY ranked

Solution 2:- In Postgresql
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(order_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS sales_month,
    SUM(order_value) AS total_sales
FROM fct_customer_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 3;
