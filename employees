QUESTION:-Given a table of employees with their respective managers, write a SQL query to generate a report that displays 
the name of each employee along with the name of their manager (if any) and the number of direct reports each manager has.

To clarify, the manager_name column may have NULL values for top-level managers (those with no manager_id). 
These employees have no manager, so their manager_name should be blank or NULL in the output.

Table is:- employees 

Solution:- In Postgre
WITH empMgr AS(
SELECT emp.id AS employeeId, emp.name AS employeeName,
emp.manager_id AS managerId, mgr.name AS managerName
FROM employees AS emp LEFT JOIN employees AS mgr
ON emp.manager_id=mgr.id
),
managerDirectReports AS(
SELECT manager_id, COUNT(*) AS totalEmp
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY manager_id
)
SELECT empMgr.employeeName, empMgr.managerName, managerDirectReports.totalEmp
FROM empMgr LEFT JOIN managerDirectReports ON empMgr.managerId=managerDirectReports.manager_id
