QUESTION:- Establish the email activity rank for each user, considering the total number of emails sent. The user sending the most emails secures rank 1 and so on. 
Output includes user, total emails, and their activity rank. Records are organized by total emails in descending order, and for users with the same email count, 
alphabetical sorting is applied.

Table is:- google_gmail_emails

Solution 1:- In PostgreSQL
WITH allDetails AS(
SELECT from_user,
COUNT(*) AS totalEmails
FROM google_gmail_emails 
GROUP BY from_user
)

SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY totalEmails DESC, from_user) AS ranked FROM allDetails

Solution 2:-
SELECT  
        from_user, 
        COUNT(*) as total_emails, 
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( order by COUNT(*) desc, from_user asc) AS rank
    FROM google_gmail_emails 
    GROUP BY from_user
    ORDER BY 2 DESC;
