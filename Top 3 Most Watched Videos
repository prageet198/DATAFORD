most users have watched as their first 3 videos. The output should include the video ID and the count of how many times it has been watched as users' first 3 videos. 
If there's a tie, all videos in the top 3 will be included.

Solution:- In Postgre
WITH allRankedData AS(
SELECT user_id, video_id,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER  BY watched_at) AS rankNo
FROM user_video_watch
),
top3UserWiseVideos AS(
SELECT * 
FROM allRankedData 
WHERE rankNo<=3
),
overAllRank AS (
SELECT video_id, COUNT(*) AS wathCount,
RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS ranked
FROM top3UserWiseVideos
GROUP BY video_id
)
SELECT video_id, wathcount FROM overAllRank WHERE ranked<=3
