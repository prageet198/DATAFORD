QUESTION:-You have recently joined Apple's speech recognition team and have been assigned a task to evaluate the consistency 
across different voice-enabled device types in rendering text responses. 
There are five distinct tables named table1, table2, table3, table4, and table5.

Your objective is to write a SQL query that identifies texts that are rendered by at least three different device types.

For instance, if Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant all render the text "Hi, how is your day?" in response to a particular speech input, 
that text should be included in your result.

Solution:- In Postgre
WITH combineData AS (
SELECT * FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM table2
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM table3
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM table4
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM table5
)
SELECT text
FROM combineData
GROUP BY text
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT device_type)>=3
