QUESTION:-Creating a na√Øve forecast entails setting all forecasts to the last observation's value. In our scenario, 
we apply this to the "distance per dollar" metric (calculated as distance_to_travel/monetary_cost). Summing distance 
and cost on a monthly basis yields actual values, and forecasted values come from the previous month. To assess accuracy, 
we use the root mean squared error (RMSE), computed as sqrt(mean(square(actual - forecast))). Report the rounded RMSE to the 2nd decimal place for a concise analysis.

Table is:- uber_request_logs 

Solution:- In Postgre
WITH monthly AS (
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM request_date) AS monthId, distance_to_travel, monetary_cost 
FROM uber_request_logs 
),
dpdCalculation AS(
SELECT monthId, SUM (distance_to_travel)/SUM(monetary_cost) AS dpd
FROM monthly
GROUP BY monthId
),
forecast AS (
SELECT monthId, dpd, LAG(dpd,1,0) OVER(ORDER BY monthId) AS previousDpd
FROM dpdCalculation
),
morePower AS(
SELECT monthId, dpd, previousDpd,
POWER(previousDpd-dpd,2) AS powered
FROM forecast
)
SELECT ROUND(SQRT(AVG(powered))::DECIMAL ,2) as rmse
FROM morePower
