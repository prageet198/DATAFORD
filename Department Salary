QUESTION:- Write a query to to find the names of the employees with the highest and lowest salaries in each department. For this question, 
let's assume that everyone at the company has different salaries.

Table is:- employee 

Solution 1:- In Postgre
WITH allMaxSalary AS(
SELECT employee_id, dep_id, employee_name,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dep_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS maxSalary
FROM employee ORDER BY dep_id
),
onlyMaxSalary AS(
SELECT employee_id, dep_id, employee_name FROM allMaxSalary WHERE maxSalary='1'
),
allMinSalary AS(
SELECT employee_id, dep_id, employee_name,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dep_id ORDER BY salary) AS minSalary
FROM employee ORDER BY dep_id
),
onlyMinSalary AS(
SELECT employee_id, dep_id, employee_name FROM allMinSalary WHERE minSalary='1'
)
SELECT onlyMaxSalary.dep_id, onlyMaxSalary.employee_name AS maxSalEmp,
onlyMinSalary.employee_name AS minSalEmp
FROM onlyMaxSalary INNER JOIN onlyMinSalary
ON onlyMaxSalary.dep_id=onlyMinSalary.dep_id

Solution-2:- In Postgre
WITH my_employees AS (
SELECT
employee_name,
dep_id,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dep_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_desc,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dep_id ORDER BY salary) AS rank_asc
FROM employee
)

SELECT
dep_id,
CASE WHEN rank_desc = 1 THEN employee_name END AS max_sal_emp,
CASE WHEN rank_asc = 1 THEN employee_name END AS min_sal_emp
FROM my_employees
