QUESTION:- Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR %) of an app in 2022. The CTR is defined as the percentage of clicks out of all impressions made in the year 2022.
Output the results in percentages rounded to 2 decimal places.
Notes:
    The percentage of click-through rate = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
    To avoid integer division, you should multiply the click-through rate by 100.0, not 100.
	
Table is:- events 

Solution 1:- In PostgreSQL
WITH products AS(
SELECT app_id,
(CASE WHEN event_type='impression' THEN '1' ELSE '0' END) AS totalImpression,
(CASE WHEN event_type='click' THEN '1' ELSE '0' END) AS totalClick
FROM events WHERE EXTRACT (YEAR FROM timestamp)='2022'
)
SELECT app_id,
ROUND(100.0 * ((SUM (CAST (totalClick AS decimal)))/(SUM (CAST (totalImpression AS decimal)))),2) AS ctr
FROM products
GROUP BY app_id
ORDER BY app_id

Solution 2:- In PostgreSQL
WITH my_events AS (

SELECT 
    app_id, 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 END) AS nb_of_clicks,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 END) AS nb_of_impressions
FROM events
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('year',timestamp) = '2022-01-01'
GROUP BY 1)

SELECT
    app_id,
    ROUND(100.00*nb_of_clicks/nb_of_impressions,2) AS ctr
FROM my_events
