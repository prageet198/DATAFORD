QUESTION:- As a new analyst at Tiktok, you are provided with 2 tables. The first table, named emails, contains records of user email signups. 
The second table, texts, contains information about the text confirmation received by each user.

Your goal is to calculate the email confirmation rate. This rate is defined as the % of emails who have been confirmed. Round your result to 2 decimal points.

Tables are:- emails, texts 

Solution-1:- In Postgre
WITH commonUsers AS (
SELECT DISTINCT(emails.email_id), texts.signup_action
FROM emails LEFT JOIN texts ON emails.email_id=texts.email_id
)
SELECT ROUND(CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN signup_action='Confirmed' THEN 1 END) AS DECIMAL) / COUNT(*), 2) AS ratio
FROM commonUsers;

Solution-2:- In Postgre
SELECT 
    ROUND(1.00*COUNT(DISTINCT texts.email_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT emails.email_id),2) 
           AS activation_rate
FROM emails
LEFT JOIN texts ON emails.email_id = texts.email_id 
                   AND texts.signup_action = 'Confirmed';
