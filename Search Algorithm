QUESTION:- Meta/Facebook is developing a search algorithm for users to explore their post history. Your task is to assess its performance 
using a table that includes the user's search term, search result positions, and whether the user clicked on the result.

Write a query to assign ratings to searches as follows:

    If the search wasn't clicked for any term, assign a rating of 1.
    If the search was clicked but the top position of clicked terms was outside the top 3 positions, assign a rating of 2.
    If the search was clicked and the top position of a clicked term was in the top 3 positions, assign a rating of 3.

Since a search ID can contain multiple search terms, select the highest rating for that search ID. Output the search ID and its highest rating.

Example: For search_id 1, it was clicked (clicked = 1), and its position is outside the top 3 positions (search_results_position = 5), resulting in a rating of 2.

Table is:- fb_search_events

Solution-1:- In Postgre

WITH data AS(
SELECT search_id,
CASE WHEN clicked='0' THEN '1'
     WHEN clicked='1' AND search_results_position>3 THEN '2'
     ELSE '3' END AS rating
FROM fb_search_events 
)
SELECT search_id, MAX(rating)
FROM data
GROUP BY search_id
ORDER BY search_id

Solution-2:- In Postgre
WITH cte AS
  (SELECT search_id,
          UNNEST(array[one, two, three]) AS rating
   FROM
     (SELECT search_id,
             CASE
                 WHEN clicked = 0 THEN 1
                 ELSE 0
             END AS one,
             CASE
                 WHEN clicked = 1
                      AND search_results_position > 3 THEN 2
                 ELSE 0
             END AS two,
             CASE
                 WHEN clicked = 1
                      AND search_results_position <= 3 THEN 3
                 ELSE 0
             END AS three
      FROM fb_search_events) a)
SELECT search_id,
       MAX(rating) AS max_rating
FROM cte
GROUP BY 1
