QUESTION:- Amazon has partnered with multiple airlines to enhance their in-flight entertainment systems. As part of this initiative, 
you are tasked with developing a feature that suggests movies from Amazon's content database.

For flight 101, suggest movies with runtimes less than or equal to the flight's duration.

Tables are:- entertainment_catalog , flight_schedule 

Solution 1:- In PostgreSQL
SELECT
    fs.flight_id,
    ec.movie_id,
    ec.duration AS movie_duration
FROM flight_schedule fs
INNER JOIN entertainment_catalog ec ON ec.duration <= fs.flight_duration
WHERE
    fs.flight_id = 101;


Solution 2:- In PostgreSQL
SELECT '101' AS flight_id, movie_id, duration
FROM entertainment_catalog
WHERE duration <= (SELECT flight_duration
FROM flight_schedule 
WHERE flight_id='101')
