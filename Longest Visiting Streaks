Table is:- user_streaks 

Solution:-In Postgre
WITH previousData AS (
SELECT user_id, date_visited,
LAG(date_visited,1) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY date_visited) AS previousDay
FROM user_streaks
WHERE date_visited<='2023-08-20'
),
difference AS (
SELECT * ,
DATE_PART('day', date_visited -  previousDay) AS dayDifference
FROM previousData
),
status AS (
SELECT *,
CASE WHEN daydifference=1 OR daydifference IS NULL THEN '0'
ELSE '1' END AS statusUpdated
FROM difference
),
combined AS (
SELECT user_id, date_visited, statusUpdated,
SUM(statusUpdated::int) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY date_visited) AS combinedGroup
FROM status),
calculation AS (
SELECT user_id, combinedGroup,
COUNT(*) AS streakLength
FROM combined
GROUP BY user_id, combinedGroup
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
),
ranking AS (
SELECT user_id, streakLength,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY streakLength DESC) AS ranked
FROM calculation
)
SELECT user_id, streakLength
FROM ranking
WHERE ranked <=3
