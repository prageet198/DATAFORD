QUESTION:- Can you write a SQL query to determine the top employee based on customer votes? We're interested in employees who've received votes when customers leave 
their 10-digit phone numbers in the "customer_response" field. Remember, we're looking for valid 10-digit phone numbers.

If 2, or more employees have the same number of votes, display all of them.

Table is:- customer_responses 

Solution-1:- In Postgre
WITH filteredData AS (
SELECT employee_id, COUNT(*) AS totalEmp
FROM customer_responses 
WHERE customer_response ~ '^[0-9]{10}$'
GROUP BY employee_id
),
ranking AS (
SELECT *, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY totalEmp DESC) AS ranked
FROM filteredData
)

SELECT employee_id, totalEmp FROM ranking WHERE ranked='1'

Solution-2:- In Postgre
WITH my_responses AS (

SELECT 
  employee_id,
  COUNT(*) AS responses,
  RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rnk
FROM customer_responses
WHERE customer_response ~ '^[0-9]+$' AND LENGTH(customer_response)=10
GROUP BY 1)

SELECT
  employee_id,
  responses
FROM my_responses
WHERE rnk = 1
