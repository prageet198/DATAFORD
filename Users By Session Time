QUESTION:-Calculate the average time each user spent in a session.

A session means the time between a 'page_load' and 'page_exit' event. If a user has multiple identical events in a day, 
pick the latest 'page_load' and earliest 'page_exit', making sure the 'page_load' happens before 'page_exit'.

Table is:- user_actions 

Solution:- In Postgre
WITH allData AS(
SELECT user_id, 
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp) AS date,
    MAX(CASE WHEN action = 'page_load' THEN timestamp END) AS eventStart,
    MIN(CASE WHEN action = 'page_exit' THEN timestamp END) AS eventEnd
FROM user_actions
GROUP BY user_id, EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp)
),
timeDifference AS(
SELECT user_id,
ROUND(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM eventEnd - eventStart),1) AS time_difference_seconds
FROM allData 
)
SELECT user_id, AVG(time_difference_seconds) AS avgSessionTime 
FROM timeDifference 
WHERE time_difference_seconds IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY user_id
