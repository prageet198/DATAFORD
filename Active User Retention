QUESTION:-Assume you have the user_actions table that contains information on Facebook user actions.

Write a query to obtain the number of active users as of July 2022.

An active user is a user who has one of these actions ("sign-in", "like", or "comment") in the current month and last month.

Table is:- user_actions

Solution-1:- In Postgre
WITH data AS (
SELECT user_id,
event_type,
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date) AS extractedMonth,
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM event_date) AS extractedYear
FROM user_actions
),
filterd AS (
SELECT user_id,event_type,extractedMonth
FROM data
WHERE extractedMonth IN (6,7) AND extractedYear='2022'
),
calclation AS (
SELECT user_id
FROM filterd 
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT extractedMonth)=2
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS activeUser FROM calclation

Solution-2:- In Postgre
SELECT 
      COUNT(DISTINCT cm.user_id) AS active_users
FROM user_actions cm
INNER JOIN user_actions lm ON cm.user_id=lm.user_id
AND DATE_TRUNC('month', cm.event_date)=DATE_TRUNC('month', lm.event_date)  + interval '1 month'
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', cm.event_date)='2022-07-01'
