Solution-1:- In Postgre
WITH ranked_claims AS (
    SELECT
        policy_num,
        state,
        claim_cost,
        fraud_score,
        NTILE(100) OVER (PARTITION BY state ORDER BY fraud_score DESC) AS percentile_rank
    FROM
        fraud_score 
)
SELECT policy_num,state,claim_cost,fraud_score 
FROM ranked_claims WHERE percentile_rank<=5

Solution-2:- In Postgre
WITH percentiles AS
  (SELECT state,
          PERCENTILE_CONT(0.05) within GROUP (
                                              ORDER BY fraud_score DESC) AS percentile
   FROM fraud_score
   GROUP BY state)
SELECT 
       f.policy_num,
       f.state,
       f.claim_cost,
       f.fraud_score
FROM fraud_score f
JOIN percentiles p 
ON f.state = p.state
WHERE fraud_score >= percentile
