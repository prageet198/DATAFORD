QUESTION:- Write a SQL query to calculate the % of high-frequency customers for January 2023. A high-frequency customer is defined as someone who places more 
than 5 orders in a month. Your output should only include the % of these high-frequency customers.
Round your results to 2 decimal points.

Table is delivery_order

Solution-1:- In Postgre
WITH janMonthOrder AS (
    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS totalOrdersByCustomer
    FROM delivery_order 
    WHERE EXTRACT (MONTH FROM order_timestamp) = 1
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
janTotalOrders AS(
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalOrders FROM janMonthOrder
),
moreThanFiveOrders AS(
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS custOrders FROM janMonthOrder WHERE totalOrdersByCustomer > 5
)
SELECT ROUND((CAST(custOrders AS NUMERIC) / totalOrders)::NUMERIC, 2) AS ratio 
FROM janTotalOrders, moreThanFiveOrders;

Solution-2:- In Postgre
WITH my_high_frequency AS (

    SELECT 
        customer_id
    FROM delivery_order
    WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', order_timestamp) = '2023-01-01' 
    GROUP BY 1
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5)
    
SELECT
    1.00*COUNT(DISTINCT mhf.customer_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT d.customer_id)
FROM delivery_order d
LEFT JOIN my_high_frequency mhf ON mhf.customer_id = d.customer_id
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', order_timestamp) = '2023-01-01'
