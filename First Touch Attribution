QUESTION:-Given 2 tables, attribution and user_sessions, from Etsy, your task is to calculate the first touch attribution for each user_id that converted. 
First touch attribution is defined as the channel with which the converted user was associated when they first discovered the website.

The attribution table logs a session visit for each row, and has a conversion column. If conversion is 1, then the user converted to buying on that session. 
The channel column represents which advertising platform the user was attributed to for that specific session.

Tables are:- attribution ,user_sessions 

Solution:- In Postgre
WITH my_converted_users AS (
SELECT DISTINCT
    u.user_id
FROM attribution a 
INNER JOIN user_sessions u ON u.session_id = a.session_id
WHERE conversion = 1),

my_sessions AS (

SELECT
    my_converted_users.user_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY my_converted_users.user_id 
    ORDER BY created_at) AS rnk,
    attribution.channel
FROM my_converted_users
INNER JOIN user_sessions ON user_sessions.user_id = my_converted_users.user_id
INNER JOIN attribution ON attribution.session_id = user_sessions.session_id
)

SELECT
    user_id,
    channel
FROM my_sessions
WHERE rnk = 1
