QUESTION:- You're tasked with finding employees with the highest and lowest salaries. Your output should feature the employee's ID, salary, and department.

Additionally, include a column named 'salary_type' categorizing the results as either 'Highest Salary' or 'Lowest Salary' based on their respective salary rankings.

Tables are:- worker , title 
Solution 1:- In Postgresql
WITH overallSalary AS (
SELECT MAX(salary) AS maxSalary, MIN(salary) AS minSalary
FROM worker
),
combineAll AS(
SELECT worker_id, salary, department,
CASE WHEN salary=maxsalary THEN 'Highest Salary'
     WHEN salary=minsalary THEN 'Lowest Salary' END AS salaryType
FROM overallSalary,worker
)
SELECT * FROM combineAll WHERE salaryType IS NOT NULL ORDER BY salary

Solution 2:- In Postgresql
WITH cte AS
  (SELECT *,
          RANK() OVER(
                      ORDER BY salary) AS lowest_sal,
          RANK() OVER(
                      ORDER BY salary DESC) AS highest_sal
   FROM worker)
SELECT worker_id,
       salary,
       department,
       CASE
           WHEN highest_sal = 1 THEN 'Highest Salary'
           ELSE 'Lowest Salary'
       END AS salary_type
FROM cte
WHERE lowest_sal = 1
  OR highest_sal = 1
