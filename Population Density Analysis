QUESTION:-You're currently engaged in a data analysis project at Deloitte, focusing on a dataset that includes information about different cities.

Your objective is to compute the population density for these cities, rounded to the nearest integer. To calculate the density, 
use the formula (Population / Area). Additionally, identify the cities with the minimum and maximum population densities in the dataset.

Table is:- cities_population 

Solution-1:- In Postgre
WITH cityDensity AS
(
SELECT city, country, 
CASE WHEN area='0' THEN NULL
ELSE (population/area) END AS density
FROM cities_population 
),
minumumDenisty AS (
SELECT city, country, density
FROM cityDensity
WHERE density IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY density ASC, country DESC
LIMIT 1
),
maximumDenisty AS (
SELECT city, country, density
FROM cityDensity
WHERE density IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY density DESC, country ASC
LIMIT 1
)
SELECT * FROM minumumDenisty
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM maximumDenisty

Solution-2:- In Postgre
WITH density AS (
    SELECT 
        city, 
        country, 
        ROUND(population / NULLIF(area, 0)) AS density
    FROM 
        cities_population
    WHERE 
        area > 0
),
max_density AS (
    SELECT 
        city, 
        country, 
        density
    FROM 
        density
    WHERE 
        density = (SELECT MAX(density) FROM density)
    LIMIT 1
),
min_density AS (
    SELECT 
        city, 
        country, 
        density
    FROM 
        density
    WHERE 
        density = (SELECT MIN(density) FROM density)
    LIMIT 1
),
combined_density AS (
    SELECT * FROM max_density
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM min_density
)
SELECT 
    city, 
    country, 
    density
FROM 
    combined_density
ORDER BY 
    density ASC;
